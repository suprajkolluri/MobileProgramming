# Multi View Android Application

This is a multiple view Android app for managing MovieDescriptions. The app is based on the first single view Android app, which used a Json description of a movie description, and displayed the information in the MovieDescription class. This app is similar to that one, but uses more complex controls and multiple views to display and manage a collection of MovieDescription objects. The MovieLibrary class retains movie description objects. The app will provide a list of all movie titles contained in the collection. It will allow the user to select one title and see all of the information about that title, and it will provide the ability to add or remove movie description entries. New descriptions can be added to the collection by the user manually entering the appropriate information needed to create a MovieDescription object. The following fields are included: Title, Year, Rated, Released, Runtime, Genre, Actors, and Plot.


The following features are used in the app:

* Action Bar.
* ListView with a properly formed adapter.
* Basic controls: Button, EditText/TextView, and a Picker or Spinner.
